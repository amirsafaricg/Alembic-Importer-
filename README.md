Setup mesh materials to different alembic files of the same model 

this plugin is designed to help animators wich use unity as an animation rendering software to setup all of the mesh materials from a model to another at the same order . example of usage : you have a character that has 2 different animations but same material and seperate files . for merging materials import both files and setup materials . for copy pasting them to another mesh . drag the second model to the scene . in the info holder insert the first model to the "replace with " and set the number of child depth based on the count of parents of materialized mesh parts of both models . hit "Change Material" and "Change Model " Done . Enjoy !
